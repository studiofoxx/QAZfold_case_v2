# QAZfold_case_v2
This is a side case design for the QAZfold created by sumandrew and scaled to fit the R1 dimensions.
V2 was still too short so I scaled it further. The v2 may not fit all cases so please make sure you measure to fit your board.

**The v2.3 case design was never tested, it was just designed based off corrective measurements of the v2.
If you plan on printing the case without modification I recommend using the v3 version right away.**

If you dont want to measure or dont have the means, use the v3 version right away as I know it fits.

TODO: The design is great to close up the sides, but I still feel the entire thing can be used as a case.
I plan on implementing a bottom piece that fits together with the side pieces, as a full three piece, interlocking case design.
